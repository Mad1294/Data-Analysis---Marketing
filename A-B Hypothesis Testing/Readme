 # AB Testing Data Analysis Project

## Introduction
In A/B testing, we analyze the results of two marketing strategies to choose the best one for future marketing campaigns.
It involves comparing the performance of different approaches to achieve a common goal, such as boosting sales, increasing followers, or driving traffic. 
By evaluating the outcomes of previous marketing campaigns, it determines which strategy is more effective and should be implemented in future initiatives.

## Research Question
The goal of this data analysis project is to visualize and interpret the results of A/B testing conducted on two different marketing strategies. 
Specifically, aim to understand the impact of each strategy on sales, engagement, and other relevant metrics. 
By visualizing the data, we seek to identify patterns, trends, and insights that can inform decision-making and optimize future marketing efforts.

## Conclusion
From the above A/B tests, we found that the control campaign resulted in more sales and engagement from the visitors.
More products were viewed from the control campaign, resulting in more products in the cart and more sales.
But the conversion rate of products in the cart is higher in the test campaign. 
The test campaign resulted in more sales according to the products viewed and added to the cart. And the control campaign results in more sales overall. 
So, the Test campaign can be used to market a specific product to a specific audience, and the Control campaign can be used to market multiple products to a wider audience.
