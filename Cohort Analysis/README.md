# Cohort Analysis Data Analysis Project

## Introduction
Cohort Analysis is a powerful data analysis technique used to gain insights into the behavior and characteristics of specific groups of users or customers over time. 
By analyzing cohorts based on defined characteristics or events, businesses can better understand user behavior and make informed decisions to improve customer engagement and retention.

## Goal
The goal of this data analysis project is to perform Cohort Analysis using Python and visualize the findings effectively. 
It aims to identify trends and patterns in user behavior over time, analyze key performance metrics for different cohorts, and draw actionable insights to optimize business strategies.

## Conclusion
Through Cohort Analysis, it was observed fluctuations in the number of new and returning users from week to week. 
Notably, there was a significant increase in both new and returning users in Week 47. 
Additionally, the average duration of user engagement on Day 1 and Day 7 varied across the weeks, suggesting potential factors influencing user behavior. 
By leveraging Cohort Analysis, businesses can make data-driven decisions to improve user engagement and drive growth.
